Personal Story

The Story So Far: Mama used to let Wendy play with her necklace when she was small. The strange eye-in-star design was one of her earliest memories. Mama would tell her stories and Wendy would spin the necklace and watch as it glittered.

Then, word came that her father had been lost at sea, and Mama started acting strange. She drew unusual symbols in chalk all over the house and read bizarre and terrible books. Wendy went to the orphanage. Before they took her away, Mama gave her the necklace. "Keep this close, Wendy. It'll protect you when I can't. Always remember that your Mama loves you."

Wendy stayed in the orphanage for several years before running away, finally deciding that she could take better care of herself the state could.

Now, Wendy stands in front of the bank, staring at the photograph someone dropped into her cup when she wasn't looking - a photograph of her father, with an even more mysterious message written on the back, "Soon the Red Tide rises. Stay safe, my little girl."

Looking up, Wendy feels something welling up inside her that she hasn't felt for many years - hope.
