Personal Story

The Story So Far: George Barnaby always had the need for control - control of his life and of his surroundings. That's why, after spending a month in jail at the age of 19 for a crime he didn't commit, George became a lawyer.

Possessing a keen mind and a charismatic personality, he found that he excelled in his chosen field and soon rose to a position of power and wealth. George enjoyed the challenge of practicing law, and the years rolled past in a pleasant blur until he was ready to retire. He figured that he and his wife, Maria, would buy a boat and sail around the world.

That was before the night when his home was invaded, his wife was murdered, and his house was burned to the ground by two men wearing strange amulets.

Now, he has tracked these men to the city of Arkham. They will pay for making him feel helpless, and for taking away his dear, sweet Maria. after all, if there's one thing lawyers are known for, it's collecting debts that are owed to them.
