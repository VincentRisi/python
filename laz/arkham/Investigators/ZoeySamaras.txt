Personal Story

The Story So Far: Zoey knew that she was special. She'd known it ever since God had spoken to her one night when she was six years old... the night that terrible fire took away her parents. He told her that He had chosen her from among all the people of the world to be His agent. She would protect the innocent and punish the wicked.

Since then, He came to her in times of trouble, offering guidance and comfort. He has also come to lead her to an evildoer on several occasions. In each instance, with His aid, good triumphed. Then, one day, He spoke to her, telling her to come to Arkham, where she would face her greatest challenge yet. He has not spoken to her since.

Now, as Zoey steps off the train onto the platform, she fingers her cross, feeling the wrongness of this place in her bones. Perhaps if she cleanses the city of its taint, He will speak to her once again.
