Personal Story

The Story So Far: Jacqueline witnesses the future every night. Her dreams are filled with things that have not yet come to pass-- usually terrible visions of blood and fire. This time is no different. She has dreamed of a city called Arkham. A quiet town that is to be destroyed by a terrible creature before the world is plunged into indescribable chaos for a thousand years. Her dreams have never been wrong before.

Unable to ignore this latest vision, Jaqueline did some research and found the location of the doomed city. Now she has come to the place that haunts her to try and stop the destruction she knows will come. Drawn to an image from her darkest dreams, she takes a deep breath as she enters the Curiositie Shoppe-- a place she knows will soon become a nightmare made flesh.
