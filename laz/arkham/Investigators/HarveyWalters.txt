Personal Story

The Story So Far: Harvey is a visiting Professor at Miskatonic University. With Doctorates in History and Archaeology, he has uncovered several interesting artifacts over the years and learned a little of the arcane arts. Recently, by carefully studying the papers and talking to people in the streets, he has begun to detect a disturbance in the city-- something that could potentially herald the arrival of something unthinkable from beyond time and space.

Checking his notes, Professor Walters prepares himself for one last trip into the streets of Arkham to confirm his theory. If he's right, it could spell the end of everything.

Clarification

The Strong Mind ability only applies to involuntary losses. Voluntary expenditures to gain some benefit (such as casting a Spell) are not affected. (Source: Page 10 of The Dunwich Horror Rulebook)

Mythos Source

Harvey Walters is the name of the sample character in the Call of Cthulhu rulebook.
