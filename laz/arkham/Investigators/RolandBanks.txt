Personal Story

The Story So Far: Methodical. By the book. If you looked in the Federal Agent's handbook, you'd find a picture of Roland Banks next to those sections. At least, if it had any pictures, you would.

Where other agents found the rules restricting and annoying, Roland took comfort in procedure. It was a relief to have guidelines to follow in any given situation. Well, at least until this latest case.

Try as he might, Roland could find no mention in the handbook of what to do when confronted with strange creatures, gates through time and space, or magic spells. This case was rapidly escalating into a fiasco, and if he dropped the ball, losing his job was the least of his worries.

Sitting outside the Asylum after an interview with yet another demented witness, Roland dropped his battered Agent's handbook back into his briefcase and sighed. At least the agency was sending him some backup. Maybe they could help him make some sense out of this mess.
