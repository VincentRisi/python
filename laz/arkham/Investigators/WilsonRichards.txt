Personal Story

PsWilsonRichardsBack.png PsWilsonRichardsFront.png PsWilsonRichardsPassed.png PsWilsonRichardsFailed.png


The Story So Far: You see a lot of strange things on the road, and Wilson has been traveling for many years now. Wandering from town to town, he's earned his keep by taking various odd jobs - but he's never seen anything like the events occuring in Arkham.

Something's just not right here, and when you're a loner and a drifter by trade, you develop a certain sixth sense about people and places. Right now Wilson's sixth sense is telling him to get out of town, and fast. But for some reason his curiosity is greater than his fear, and he has a weird feeling that the job he needs to do in Arkham may be a little bigger than mending a step or painting a fence.

Clarification

Wilson has a Focus of 4 for purposes of game effects.
