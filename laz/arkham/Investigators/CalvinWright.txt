Errata

As per the official Arkham League FAQ, Calvin's "Been Through Hell" ability applies whenever a special effect would decrease one of his statistics, including maximum Sanity or maximum Stamina (but not including current Sanity or Stamina) below its normal level. It does not apply when losing a bonus to that statistic above his normal maximum (for instance, when discarding Duke). The ability has no effect in a Final Battle against Cthulhu.
