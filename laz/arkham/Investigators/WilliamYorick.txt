Personal Story

The Story So Far: If all the world truly was a stage, then William Yorick felt he had a bit part at best. After studying for years to become a Shakespearean actor, he found that dramatic monologues didn't put bread on the table. So, desperate for work, he had accepted a job as a gravedigger.

He figured that while gravedigging was an unusual job, there wasn't really anything wrong with it. After all, one of Shakespeare's best scenes involved a gravedigger. Sure, the work was hard and dirty, but William had never shied away from honest labor before.

That, of course, was before the weird corpses began turning up. Strange, inhuman things, they caused William's flesh to crawl and his palms to sweat. He began to see strangers watching him wherever he went, and he knew instinctively that taking the corpses to the University would be the last mistake he ever made.

Which is why William find himself in the pews at South Church. While he has never been a particularly religious man, he finds that Father Michael usually has good advice. Today, William feels like that could make all the difference in the world.
