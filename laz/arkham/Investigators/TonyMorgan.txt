Personal Story

The Story So Far: Tony didn't know what it was that he'd killed, but it had nearly taken his arm off at the shoulder, and he still couldn't quite control his trembling at the touch of water.

The thing had the form of a man, more or less, but it had been covered in loathsome scales and slime, like some horrid creature of the deep. Miles from the sea, it had made for the river when it scented him on its trail. The abomination stank of salt water, rotten fish, and the blood of the farm animals it had mutilated to sate its unwholesome hunger.

He should've let it go when it dove into the river, but he'd never let a bounty escape before, and he hadn't been about to start then. Drawing his knife, he'd gone in after it, and everything had become a blur of blood, shrieking horror, and muddy water.

Three days later, he'd awakened in the hospital, muttering to himself and shaking with a mixture of fear and anger over his escaped quarry.

After two weeks, the doctors have finally declared him fit enough to leave and get back to his hunt. But this time, his prey isn't human, whatever it is.
